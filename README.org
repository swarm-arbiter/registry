* Overview

	Runs a docker registry that can have images pushed/pulled from it, as well as a frontend GUI to view the contents of the registry, and a record of events (eg, images pushed, pulled, etc)

* Issues

** Garbage Collection

	 It is possible to delete tags from the GUI - however this does not actually free up any storage.

	 Need to run '/bin/registry garbage-collect /etc/docker/registry/config.yml' from within the registry container in order to clean up blobs which are not referred to by any tag.

	 This should be done periodically on a cron job or similar

** Password Not In Secrets

	 In order for the frontend GUI container to connect to the backend container it is required that the frontend has a login that it can use. This is stored in =appdata/resources/frontend-config.yml.dot=, and a hashed version in =backend-htpasswd.dot= -> ideally we would store the plain text in the secrets.yaml parameter file and then hash it as part of the dot template
